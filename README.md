# feather-client-vue

This library provides a fully-featured authentication form (sign-in, sign-up, and password-resets) as a single Vue component. Under the hood, this library wraps the [feather-client-js](https://github.com/feather-id/feather-client-js) library. If you like to build your own custom authentication forms, please checkout that library as well.
